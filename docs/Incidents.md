# `status.io` - Incidents

## Background

"Incidents" cover a range of events. They could be defined by the fact that they're **not** _Maintenance_. If a server is running slow, unreachable for a geographic range, unavailable due to being off-line for a security patch, or just plain non-functional - it is an incident. Creating, updating, and resolving incidents allows the community to see what is going on and adjust their expectations accordingly.
