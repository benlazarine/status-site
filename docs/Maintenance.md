5. Select services to put into maintenance

Note: a Status.io now offers "automation" for the "start" & "finish" states in a Maintenance. You have the option to turn this on with creating a maintenance. See their [Knowledge Base for more information](http://kb.status.io/planned-maintenance/maintenance-lifecycle/). 

### Updating a Maintenance

Periodic updates can be made to a Maintenance. This may be helpful if an issue has been encountered that may delay the completion of Maintenance. 


### Resolving/Clearing a Maintenance

Without using "automation", a Maintenance will need for be resolved, or cleared.
